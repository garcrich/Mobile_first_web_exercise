# Mobile_first_web_exercise
This was a mobile first exercise for a real detailing company in Hawaii

#Purpose of Project

This project was to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS as well as find my weaknesses and what 
I need to improve on. While I have done many projects and courses, this was my first true project without any outside direction.

#How to Inspect

You can simply expand and contract the browser to see the different breakpoints for this project.

#Features

Along with basic HTML markup and CSS some more advanced features were used. jQuery, media queries, CSS animations, and SEO tags were
all used to improve the page. 

#Findings and Areas to Improve

The biggest finding was the need to come up with a sketch of wireframes for all views (phone, tablet, desktop) first. I simply made 
one page for mobile in CorelDRAW when I should have made sketches 1st. This took a huge toll on my HTML and CSS semantics and took
much more time than expected to correct in the browser.

The goal was to only use CSS for this Website but when getting to the services tab this proved futile. In the future I will include 
jQuery on select pages at the cost of performance. Perhaps even going at far as to writing JavaScript it improve semantics. 

Grid layout proved to be a huge problem and could have been solved from the start with sketches. In the future I'll be sure to become
familiar with bootstrap and try to only use the grid option to avoid bloat on future projects after becoming familiar with Bootstrap.

My biggest weakness is with graphic design. I will not upload another website until I have 150 hours study in graphic design software 
and theory. 

In the upcoming projects I will layout my framework before starting a project as it seems that this would have saved me the most time and markup.
